#MyHeart
MyHeart is a web application that empowers patients to take control of their own health by submitting healthcare information such as biological, behavioral, and socioeconomic factors. The focus of MyHeart is on addressing socioeconomic factors that can contribute to the development of various health conditions, including heart disease.

##Features
MyHeart uses three models to provide personalized recommendations and risk assessments for users:

Biological Model 1
Biological Model 2
Community-based Risk Model
The application is built using React, Node.js, NextUI, and REST APIs for the web app, and Python with scikit-learn for the backend. MyHeart uses K-Folding to evaluate the performance of each model and to determine the best parameters.
